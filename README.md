## Purpose & Scope

This repository contains the implementation of a multi-tenant compliance platform intended for use by regulated organizations, boards of directors, compliance officers, and external reviewers.

The system is designed to:
- Aggregate compliance-relevant data
- Surface potential risk indicators
- Support structured oversight and documentation
- Preserve audit-ready evidence

The system is **not** designed to:
- Make regulatory determinations
- Certify compliance
- Replace human decision-making
- Act as legal, tax, or regulatory counsel

---

## Compliance Responsibility Boundary

Responsibility for compliance remains with:
- The organization
- Its management
- Its board of directors

Magnus Compliance Engine provides tooling and structured support to assist those parties in fulfilling their obligations.

## AI & Automation Principles

Where artificial intelligence or automated analysis is used:
- Outputs are advisory in nature
- Results are explainable and reviewable
- Human oversight is required
- All outputs are logged and auditable

No automated process within the system executes compliance decisions without human review.

---

## Intended Users

- Compliance officers
- Risk and governance teams
- Board members (read-only or oversight access)
- External auditors or regulators (restricted, read-only access where appropriate)

---

## Repository Status

This repository is under active development.

Features are implemented incrementally with a priority on:
- Regulatory defensibility
- Auditability
- Deterministic system behavior
- Clear separation of responsibility

## Legal Notice

Nothing in this repository constitutes legal, tax, accounting, or regulatory advice.

Use of this system does not transfer or reduce compliance responsibility from the organization or its governing body.
